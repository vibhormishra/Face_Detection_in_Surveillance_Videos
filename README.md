# Face_Detection_in_Surveillance_Videos
FInal Project for course: Computer Vision CSCI 5722


Readme:

1)	Extract all files and folders of zip to one folder.
2)	Run the file ‘detectAndTrackFaces.m’ from the main folder.
3)	Choose if you want to use the already made classifier or train the classifier with the data already present in the folder ‘cv_imageset’. (if you are adding new dataset, add to the same folder and folder name should remain unchanged)
4)	Choose if you want video feed from an already uploaded video or from the webcam.
5)	Choose if unknown faces should be detected or not. If detected, then it would say as ‘unknown’ otherwise it wouldn’t detect the face at all.
